      <description>In the NFL, 32 teams play 16 games in 17 weeks for the chance to play in the Super Bowl. That means that a full NFL season, from preseason to Super Bowl, is roughly seven months. Teams donâ€™t just compete during this time frame though. The real work for the Lombardi Trophy begins after the Super Bowl.
The offseason is my favorite part of football. I love the idea of building a team through a draft, recruiting, or free agency.</description>

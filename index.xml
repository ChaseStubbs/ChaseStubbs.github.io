      <description>In the NFL, 32 teams play 16 games in 17 weeks for the chance to play in the Super Bowl. That means that a full NFL season, from preseason to Super Bowl, is roughly seven months. Teams don’t just compete during this time frame though. The real work for the Lombardi Trophy begins after the Super Bowl.
The offseason is my favorite part of football. I love the idea of building a team through a draft, recruiting, or free agency.</description>

      <description>The NBA draft is conducted much different than other major sports drafts. The NBA allows teams to trade a player immediately after they are selected which creates an interesting dynamic. A drafted player can wear the hat for one team but then end up being on a different team a few minutes later.
In the 2018 NBA Draft, The Atlanta Hawks took Luka Dončić with the 3rd overall pick.</description>

      <description>I am going to take the data given to me for this assignment and separate a column into new columns. I also would like to clean up the data to be easier to read and use for later projects. The first step is always to load the library tidyverse. I also added ggalt for future use.
library(tidyverse) ## ── Attaching packages ─────────────────────────────────────── tidyverse 1.3.0 ── ## ✓ ggplot2 3.</description>
